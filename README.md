## Overview of the analysis
Pewlett Hackard needed a way to accurately assess their workforce to anticipate natural attrition.

Finally, with attrition comes a younger workforce to replace, typically. This retirement information based on eligiblity also helped sort people who were great candidates for mentorship opportunities to keep the Pewlett Hackard workforce running with expertise.
