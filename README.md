# Pewlett Hackard, An Aging Company
## Overview of the analysis
Pewlett Hackard needed a way to accurately assess their workforce to anticipate natural attrition. In this analysis, I sorted data and created new tables to depict the total number of employees that were approaching their retirement eligiblity, as well as provided numerical values associated with each title in the Pewlett Hackard labor category system. Finally, with attrition comes a younger workforce to replace, typically. This retirement information based on eligiblity also helped sort people who were great candidates for mentorship opportunities to keep the Pewlett Hackard workforce running with expertise.

## Results
-There are 41,381 Pewlett Hackard employees eligible for retirement. This is concerning for a tech company to have a workforce that rivals Congress in their age distribution. Will require a massive overhaul in their recruitment department to satisfy this level of workforce.
-It appears that their managers are strapped with the amount of managers to other labor categories correlation. 2 Managers retiring compared to, for example, 29,414 Senior Engineers. This could indicate that the leadership positions will provide consistency in the next wave of Pewlett Hackard employees.
-With such a large workforce, the employees eligible for mentorship programs is extremely high. This will provide great educational resources for newer personnel and ultimately sustain growth longterm for this company.
-Based on the retiring personnel, it appears that most of those who put in relatively lengthy employment lengths into Pewlett Hackard, work up in their system. Promoting within makes a company attractive and could easily obtain top-notch candidates with this fact alone.

## Summary
-How many roles will be need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" befings to make an impact? --> 41,381 slots, 7 labor categories (Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, Manager)
-Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? --> Yes. That seems like a high-level response. I was concerned initially about the Manager category not having sufficient mentorship resources, but it appears that there are about 6 eligible personnel to fit this bill. Otherwise, the 6 other labor categories have thousands of elibigle mentors. My next question would be to analyze how many mentors per mentee, but that is a different conversation.
